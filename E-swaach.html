                                <p>This potent vision was put into action starting off with a grand inauguration ceremony of the
                                    E-Swachha club by TEJASVI SURYA, honorable MP of South Bangalore on December 1st of
                                    2024. His profound words and unwavering support furthered our cause. With great cause comes
                                    great responsibility hence the club president and leads were given their badges of their
                                    respective roles and from there the journey of bringing about a revolution in e-waste setfoot. The
                                    Inauguration ceremony created a impact by attracting a huge audience and also created a sense of
                                    civic responsibility among the masses on e-waste which motivated the students of BIT to join
                                    our club and embark on this journey of change together.</p>

                                <p>Recycling e-waste is crucial in combating environmental damage by preventing the release 
                                    of harmful materials into the environment. The BIT E-Swachha team's initiative in February 
                                    2024 to collect inoperative electronic gadgets from apartments and colleges was a 
                                    significant step in creating awareness about the importance of reusing electronic devices. 
                                    Electronic waste, if not recycled properly, can release hazardous substances like lead, 
                                    mercury, and cadmium, which contaminate the environment and pose health risks to both 
                                    humans and wildlife. The BIT E-Swachha team's efforts in organizing a collection 
                                    drive demonstrate their commitment to addressing the e-waste issue and promoting 
                                    responsible waste management practices. This initiative not only raises awareness but also 
                                    encourages individuals to take proactive step.</p>

                                <h2> E-waste management awareness walkathon at Ambedkar stadium</h2>
                                <p>The e-Swachha BIT walkathon at Ambedkar Stadium in Bangalore was a resounding 
                                    success. It aimed to raise awareness about e-waste disposal, emphasizing the importance of 
                                    proper management like reducing, reusing, and recycling e-waste. Promoting e-swachhta is 
                                    crucial, similar to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, to ensure a cleaner environment. With India 
                                    ranking as the 3rd largest e-waste producer globally, taking responsibility for managing it is 
                                    essential for a sustainable future.
                                    The walkathon, held on 12th May 2024, attracted a diverse audience, including teenagers, 
                                    kids, senior citizens, and youth, effectively spreading the message of responsible e-waste 
                                    disposal. Initiatives like this play a significant role in educating the public about the impact 
                                    of e-waste on our health and the environment.</p>
