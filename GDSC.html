                <h2>Vision & Mission Of the club</h2>
                <p>Google Developer Student Clubs are university based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or 
                    graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.</p>
                <br>● Google Developer Student Club Leads are passionate leaders at their universities who are dedicated to helping their peers learn and connect.
                <br> ● Leads are undergraduate or graduate university students pursuing various degrees, yet have foundational knowledge of software development concepts.
                <br> ● Google collaborates with Leads and supports them as they start and grow their on-campus communities.
            <br>●  Google Developer Student Clubs train thousands of student developers globally and work with their communities to solve real-life problems </p>
